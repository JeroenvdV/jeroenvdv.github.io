With a technical background and experience in various different software engineering teams, as well as managing complex projects spanning numerous business departments in a fast-paced environment, I am in an ideal position to fulfill the management needs of your team(s) or project(s). I speak both 'business' and 'software geek', which allows me to build bridges, solve problems, and maintain peace, serenity, predictability and happiness in my team.
